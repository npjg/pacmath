# Pacmath
In the spirit of [`haloweenmath`][haloweenmath], you can generate Pacman and an archetypcal ghost as math symbols and binary operators in ![equation][LaTeX].

## Acknowledgements
 - Dr. James Cook, for his zany love of Pacman as a lecture aid.
 - G. Mezzetti, author of `haloweenmath`,  for his insight into defining custom operators.

The user-level commands were adapted from the [2016 Seasonal Challenge][challenge-question] that inspired `haloweenmath`, and the bigop logic was adapted from an example given by the TeX wizard himself, [egreg][egreg-question].

## Installation
Simply include `pacmath.sty` in your ![equation][LaTeX] project directory and add the package with name `pacmath`. More official packaging coming soon.
